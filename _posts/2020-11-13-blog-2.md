This is about my personal progress through this course and a brief review about my personal project. What I leaned so far and what I achieved for last few months.

Through meetings we have decided to make an app for people who want to virtually travel, this app allows users to experience the monuments around the world in their yard. So, when we started our project, we decided to use Web GL (web app) so that many people can access to the app without downloading it. However, we accounted technical problems between Web GL and Unity. WebGL doesn’t support Unity AR foundation. So, we changed our plan quickly to make a native app and use QR code scanning to allow people to easily and quickly download the app.

Through meetings, that we developed our ideas, and we tried to adopt ‘Agile Software Development’, which allow teams to work using communication to change our plan flexibly. It did work very in the beginning but failed later in the project due to lack of technical skills and time constraints. We ended up as Waterfall style for our development cycle.

• Prototype Website

When we started to design the web prototype, we were bit confused about how we will make a website that could promote app efficiently. As marketing wise, we tried to look up many other websites that promoting their apps. Some of them directly explained their apps (for example, notion). Or some apps guided quickly users to sign up or create accounts (for example, tinder or uber).

We decided to take an approach that explained our app and then directed users to the download, because our app doesn’t need to create account and even doesn’t require their personal information (except their location).
During the development of the prototype of our website, we used Adobe XD to share the prototype and design together. Adobe XD was a useful tool for creating UX/UI design web and mobile. It really helped us to collaborate on our ideas.
First, we needed a website so users can view and discover our app.

• Prototype design for APP
Ramsha and I decided to make low feasibility prototype for documentation. It is showing the design of our app and how it works visually. We also used Adobe XD for creating the design.

• Beta demo
Our first beta demo was all about figuring out how to use AR foundation based on device GPS. When we first made a demo, we tried it out in Jeju, my hometown, and took a video. It worked great but due to the fact that google GPS doesn’t perfectly match the GPS coordinates in Korea, it located the model slightly off from original location.
